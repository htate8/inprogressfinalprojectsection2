        <h1 id="top" class="titlefont">Global Media & Entertainment</h1>
            <p>I love immersing myself in international entertainment media, finding joy in exploring films, television series, and music from diverse cultures. Each piece tells a unique story, offering fresh perspectives and introducing me to new languages, traditions, and artistic styles. Whether it's the emotional depth of a foreign drama, the energetic beats of global music, or the rich storytelling in international films, this immersion broadens my horizons and deepens my appreciation for the world’s creative expression.</p>
        
        <h3 id="film" class="titlefont">Film:</h3>
            <p>International films offer a unique lens into the values and traditions of different cultures, helping me understand perspectives that may differ from my own. Their stories often carry universal lessons or challenge my assumptions, fostering empathy and broadening my worldview. By exploring themes like family, love, or resilience, these films deepen my appreciation for the shared and distinct aspects of the human experience. Two films I suggest watching are "Petite Maman" and "Past Lives".</p>

            <img src="../img/pastlivesposter.jpg" alt="Movie poster for Past Lives" class="movieposter">
        <h4 class="titlefont">Petite Maman:</h4>
            <p>Petite Maman (2021), directed by Céline Sciamma, is a French fantasy-drama that delicately explores themes of childhood, grief, and connection. The story follows an 8-year-old girl named Nelly, who is coping with the recent loss of her grandmother. While helping her parents clean out her mother’s childhood home, Nelly ventures into the nearby woods and meets a girl her age named Marion, who is building a fort. As they spend time together, Nelly discovers that Marion is, in fact, a younger version of her mother. The film beautifully weaves a tale of intergenerational bonding, allowing Nelly to understand her mother’s experiences and emotions in a profound and magical way. The film is noted for its quiet intimacy, emotional depth, and a unique narrative that blurs the lines between past and present.</p>
        
        <h4 class="titlefont">Past Lives:</h4>
            <p>Past Lives (2023), directed by Celine Song, is a tender and contemplative romantic drama about fate, love, and the connections that transcend time. The film follows Nora and Hae Sung, two childhood friends in South Korea whose paths diverge when Nora's family emigrates to Canada. Years later, they reconnect online and rekindle their friendship, but circumstances keep them apart.</p>
            <p>Twelve years after that, Hae Sung visits Nora in New York, and the two reflect on the choices they've made and the "what ifs" of their lives. Through quiet, emotionally charged moments, the film explores themes of destiny, cultural displacement, and the lingering impact of past relationships. It's a poignant meditation on how people’s lives intertwine across different timelines and the unspoken bond that can endure despite distance and time.</p>

        <br><br><h3 id="tvseries">Television Series:</h3>
            <p>During my early teen years, I started watching TV shows made in foreign countries. I improved my Spanish when I was young by watching Disney Channel Latin America. When I began learning Korean, I also began watching Korean drama series. Although foreign TV started out as a language-learning resources for me, I have grown to enjoy the various themes and cultural values expressed in TV throughout the world. Three series that contributed to my love for foreign shows include "Soy Luna", "Twenty-Five, Twenty-One", and "What Comes After Love".</p>
        <h4>Soy Luna</h4>
            <p>Soy Luna is a Disney Channel Latin America teen drama that follows the journey of Luna Valente, a cheerful and free-spirited teenager living in Cancún, Mexico. Luna's life takes a dramatic turn when her parents receive a job offer in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Forced to move, Luna struggles to adapt to her new surroundings but finds solace in her love for roller skating.</p>
            <p>In Buenos Aires, Luna discovers Jam & Roller, a popular skating rink where she meets new friends, faces rivalries, and develops her passion for freestyle skating and music. As she navigates school, friendships, and first loves, Luna also uncovers a mysterious secret about her past that changes everything.</p>
            <p>Blending romance, music, and thrilling skating competitions, Soy Luna is a story about self-discovery, following your dreams, and embracing change. The series is known for its upbeat soundtrack, dynamic performances, and heartfelt themes of friendship and perseverance.</p>

        <h4>Twenty-Five, Twenty-One</h4>
            <p>Twenty-Five, Twenty-One (2022) is a heartwarming and nostalgic coming-of-age Korean drama that follows the lives of five young people navigating love, dreams, and friendship during the economic crisis of the late 1990s. The story centers on Na Hee-do, an ambitious high school fencer who dreams of joining the national team, and Baek Yi-jin, a former chaebol heir who is forced to rebuild his life after his family’s business collapses.</p>
            <p>Despite their struggles, Hee-do and Yi-jin form a deep bond that grows into a complex relationship as they support each other through life's challenges. As the title suggests, their journey unfolds over the years, highlighting the joy, heartbreak, and personal growth that come with youth. The drama beautifully balances romance and realism, capturing the bittersweet essence of dreams pursued and moments lost in time.</p>
            <p>With its evocative storytelling and emotional depth, Twenty-Five, Twenty-One is a touching exploration of resilience, love, and the lasting impact of formative relationships. Below, you'll find one of my favorite scenes from the show. Although simple, it has great significance within the context of the story.</p>

        <h4>What Comes After Love</h4>
            <p>What Comes After Love is a poignant Korean drama that explores the complexities of love, separation, and personal growth. The story follows the relationship between Choi Hong, a Korean woman, and Aoki Jungo, a Japanese man, as they navigate the challenges of a cross-border romance. Their love faces strains from miscommunication, cultural differences, and youthful immaturity, leading to a painful breakup. Years later, they reconnect, confronting unresolved feelings and gaining closure.</p>
            <p>The drama is known for its non-linear storytelling, beautifully blending past and present to highlight the evolution of the characters' emotions. With only six episodes, it delivers a reflective narrative enhanced by striking visuals and a delicate soundtrack, resonating deeply with themes of loss, healing, and the resilience of love.</p>
